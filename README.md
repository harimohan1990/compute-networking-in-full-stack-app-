# compute-networking-in-full-stack-app-

complete overview of how computer networking works with full-stack (frontend + backend) development and AWS deployment**, explained from request to response:

---

## 🧩 1. **Frontend (Client)**

* Runs in the browser (React, Next.js, etc.)
* Sends requests (HTTP/HTTPS) to the backend
* Example: User clicks "Submit" → `fetch('/api/data')`

---

## 🌐 2. **Internet (Computer Networking Layer)**

### Key Concepts:

* **DNS**: Converts domain name (e.g., `myapp.com`) to IP address
* **TCP/IP**: Breaks request into packets, sends over internet
* **HTTPS (SSL/TLS)**: Secures data with encryption
* **Router/Switches**: Direct the packets from client → server

---

## 🖥️ 3. **Backend (Server/API Layer)**

* Node.js / FastAPI / Express handles request
* Interacts with:

  * **Databases** (MongoDB, PostgreSQL)
  * **External APIs**
  * **Authentication services (e.g., JWT, OAuth)**

---

## 💾 4. **Database**

* Stores persistent data
* Queries are executed based on API logic
* Example: `User.findById(req.user.id)`

---

## ☁️ 5. **Cloud Hosting & Networking (AWS)**

### Common AWS Services:

| Component       | AWS Service                                  |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Web App Hosting | EC2, Elastic Beanstalk, or ECS               |
| File Storage    | S3                                           |
| DNS             | Route 53                                     |
| Load Balancer   | ALB (Application Load Balancer)              |
| SSL             | ACM                                          |
| API Gateway     | For Serverless Apps                          |
| Database        | RDS (SQL), DynamoDB (NoSQL)                  |
| CDN             | CloudFront (faster delivery)                 |
| Networking      | VPC, Security Groups, NACLs (firewall rules) |

## 🔐 Security

* **Firewalls** (AWS Security Groups + NACLs)
* **IAM**: Controls AWS resource access
* **HTTPS**: Encrypted communication
